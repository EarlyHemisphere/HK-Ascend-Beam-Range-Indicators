# HK-Ascend-Beam-Range-Indicator

Adds indicators during the Ascension phase of the Absolute Radiance fight that show the range of the beam she is firing. There are three sets of them:

1. (yellow) Real-time indicator
2. (red) Indicators that only update the moment she aims her beam to show the range that the beam that fired last could have fired within
3. (green) A line denoting a 270 degree rotation relative to the origin of the Radiance's beams. On this line, the knight's hitbox is least likely to intersect with the next laser fired

This mod is made for Hollow Knight 1.5 and requires Mod Common.
