# HK-Ascend-Beam-Range-Indicator

Adds indicators during the Ascension phase of the Absolute Radiance fight that show the range of the beam she is firing. There are two sets of them:

1. Real-time indicator (yellow)
2. Indicators that only update the moment she aims her beam to show the range that the beam that fired last could have fired within (red)

This mod is made for Hollow Knight 1.5 and requires Mod Common.
